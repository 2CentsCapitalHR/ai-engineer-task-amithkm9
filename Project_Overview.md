    # Issue severity penalties
    severity_weights = {
        "critical": -15,    # Major compliance violations
        "high": -5,         # Significant issues
        "medium": -2,       # Minor corrections needed
        "low": -1,          # Cosmetic improvements
        "info": 0           # Informational only
    }
    
    # Apply penalties for actual issues (not AI suggestions)
    for issue in issues:
        if "AI Suggestion" not in issue.source:
            base_score += severity_weights[issue.severity]
    
    # Missing document penalty (up to 25 points)
    missing_penalty = (missing_docs / total_required) * 25
    base_score -= missing_penalty
    
    # Completion bonus (up to 15 points)
    completion_bonus = (present_docs / total_required) * 15
    base_score += completion_bonus
    
    return max(0, min(100, base_score))

# Score Interpretation
90-100%: Excellent compliance, ready for submission
70-89%:  Good compliance, minor review recommended
55-69%:  Review required, minor corrections needed
35-54%:  Significant corrections required
0-34%:   Critical non-compliance detected
